# Commit-Searcher-Front

App to search commits for this specific repository front-end side

## Installation
If we want to install and run the front-end side, first we need to install the dependencies using `npm install` command (node js its important to have installed in our system) and we can run the project using the following 2 commands: `ng serve` (if we have Angular CLI installed in our system) or `npm run start` (using the package manager of node js). Its important to know that we need to have available the 4200 port, because angular and the commit-searcher-front project is configured to run on this port.

Its important to run back-end and front-end side at the same time.

Next, we can navigate to `http://localhost:4200/` and you can be able to see the commit list of this repository (if you have running the backend side too).

Note: If we want to point to another repository, we can modify the owner and repository name property in the `environment.ts` file.

That's it in the front-end side
